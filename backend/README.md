Note: Any commands are run when the current directory is in /automation_website/backend folder. We assume that you're comfortable with changing directories in your command prompt (Linux or powershell). If you're not, don't hesitate to ask me (Jun De) or people around you for help and/or pick up a quick tutorial :)

At the start of the development process:
```sudo ./setup.sh```
